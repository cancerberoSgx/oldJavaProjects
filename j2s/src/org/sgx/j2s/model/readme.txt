data representation in a OO way. 

the important is that we support object representation in the form of a map, a pure pojo
and in the more elaborated ModelElement way... the primary objective is to normalize
a the java zyntax for representing objects and to provide reflection independent way 
(ModelElement) as well as reflection javabeans and maps...

this package includes this paradigm concepts but also, basic -common types, 
the editor concept (object representation), and also mechanism of object serialization 
and objects templates
