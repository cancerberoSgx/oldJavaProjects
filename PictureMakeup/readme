First of all excuse me for my bad english.

Although a descent java development kit has excelent low-level image manipulation tools, there are almost no free projects that explote this. A was needed a free (lgpled) image manipulation program for using inside my project spforms, a html visual editor. I was looking in the web but didn't find something like that.

picture-makeup uses the excelent low level image manipulation operations that jcf-swing offers to java programmers, for implement a lot of known image operations/filters/effects/transformations like blur, sharp, noise, smooth, emboss, edge detection, color operations like bright, shade, grey scales, palettes, and image transformations like shear, rotation, scale, flip, etc. 

It also explotes the java api supporting the most famous image formats like png, gif, jpg, bmp, etc.

The idea is not another image manipulation programm (there are a lot of them and of very good quality) but a small, efficient and easy to modify program that offers java programmers high abstraction image manipulation tools.
