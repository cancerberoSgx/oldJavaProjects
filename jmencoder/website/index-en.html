<h1>My MultiMedia Tools</h1>
<h2>what is this?</h2>
<p>Sebasti√°n Gurin's multimedia tools is a set of desktop applications
related to multimedia file playing and formating. It is based on the
great <a href="">mplayer</a> and written in java. Among other things
you will find: </p>
<ul>
  <li><big><b><a href="mediaPlayer-en.html">sound and video player</a></b></big>,
supporting advanced things like subtitles, video-sound-subtitle timing
control, playing list, etc. Supports almost all video and sound major
formats like avi, flv, mp4, mp3, mkbv, etc</li>
  <li><big><b><a href="streamPlayer-en.html">Stream player (radio and
television)</a></b></big>. This is a radio and tv internet stream
player, with a nice playlist editable format, and a nice collection of
radio and tv channels of all over the world (more than 10000 cannels in
the catalog). The idea is that each user composes its own playlist and
share with the world.</li>
  <li><a href="videoFormatConversor-en.html"><b>video format conversor</b>
    </a>that will let you easily transform from-to avi, mp4, flv, etc.
Also it let you paste subtitles, with custom fonts. </li>
  <li><b>sound format conversor</b>, for example, you can easily
convert all mp4 sounds in a folder to mp3.</li>
  <li><b>desktop recorder and screenshoter</b> (experimental), with
unique features like timer, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Caution: </b>All of these applications where made to be used by
me at my home and are brought to you without any warranty. These are
not proffesional tools, so spect failures! However, they have showed to
work pretty well in most cases...<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why to use this?</span> if you want
to have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lightweight</span> set of
alternative tools, for playing all your sound and video format files,
easily do common conversion of sound and video formats, paste subtitle
to movies, listen internet radios and television, and other related
tasks, with a few clicks, easy to learn and to teach.<br>
</p>
<h2>Download and Install</h2>
<p><b>1) Make sure java is installed on the system. If not sure,
http://www.java.com.<br>
</b></p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Download and decompress <a href="TODO">file</a>. Execute
jmencoder\menu.bat. The windows release contains all required mplayer
executables and
plugins, so the user doesn't require to install anything additional.
Only extract and run.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Make sure that <span style="font-weight: bold;">mplayer</span> is
installed in your system. Some tools like video or sound format
conversors will require also <span style="font-weight: bold;">ffmpeg</span>
installed.
In particular, the commands <span style="font-weight: bold;">mplayer,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ffmpeg</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mencoder</span> must be in your PATH. <br>
</p>
Download and decompress <a href="TODO">file</a>. Execute <i>sh
jmencoder/menu.sh</i><br>
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Executing jmencoder/menu will give you a menu like the following
with links to all available applications:</p>
<p><img src="menu.png"></p>
<p><big><b>TIP</b>. The interface of these applications let you drag
and drop your files. For example, in the media player application, you
can drag a movie file to the player playlist and your subtitle file to
the subtitle input box.</big></p>
<p>TODO: make desktop recordings in windows.<br>
</p>
<h2>Hacking</h2>
<p>All these tools are based in the great mplayer project, so a lot of
credits are for mplayer's folks. These utilities are only GUI
applications interfacing with mplayer, done with java swing. <br>
</p>
<p>All java source code is included in the releases. If you want to
build the program from source code yourself: </p>
<ol>
  <li>make sure ant is installed.</li>
  <li>$ cd jmencoder/build</li>
  <li>$ ant</li>
</ol>
