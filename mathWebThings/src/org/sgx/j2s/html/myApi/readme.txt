what's this?

this are interface wrappers to html dom elements. this mean that implementation objects (the objs you touch) are native html dom objects

I decorated this abstract classes to the interface (attributes and methods) are identical to native html's and choose a subset of w3c standar supported by major dom implementations
(in fact this classes where builded from w3c dom java bindings). 

nevertheless use this at your own risk!. 
the only advantage of using this api versus yui j2s port is that this doen't requires importing a javascript toolkit.
note that there still are lots of html dom implementation's bugs (ie)

this is an independent base package
